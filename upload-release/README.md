# Upload Release Action

An action to upload releases via SCP for GeyserMC projects.

## Usage

This action requires an instance of the [GeyserMC Downloads API](https://github.com/GeyserMC/bibliothek) (forked from the Paper Downloads API) with an instance of [bibliothek-build-monitor](https://github.com/GeyserMC/bibliothek-build-monitor) watching for uploads. An SSH host, username, and private key are required and should be stored as secrets in the repository or organization. It is also assumed that a metadata.json file is present generated by the release action.

### Minimal Configuration

```yaml
- uses: GeyserMC/actions/upload-release@master
  with:
    files: | # Newline-separated list of files to upload
      file_a.json
      file_b.json
    host: ${{ secrets.DOWNLOADS_SERVER_IP }} # The IP address of the server to upload to
    privateKey: ${{ secrets.DOWNLOADS_PRIVATE_KEY }} # The private key to use for authentication
    username: ${{ secrets.DOWNLOADS_USERNAME }} # The username to use for authentication
```
